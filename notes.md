# Development notes

## Gameplay

It would be cool to do something similar to TIS-100, but on a graph format.

Either it could be exactly the same, with a different topology, programming language and so on. Or it could be programmed more centrally, so that every node uses the same code. If everyone has the same, it is more similar to real graph algorithms. Then, we could perhaps have some nodes in every level which don't behave like this. For example, we could have users program them differently, or have them pre-programmed by the level.

## Development plan

Longer goals:
- Visualize graphs
- Writing code for the nodes
- Animate execution of the graph code
- Level desiger, for us to create levels
- Sandbox, for the user to create levels

Short term goals:
- Define a graph as a json file or similarly
- Display a graph
- Menu for launching and selecting a graph to work on

## ECS structure

- Node is an entity with components:
	- Id? Maybe not a component actually.
	- Neighbor ids
	- Position
	- and so on...
